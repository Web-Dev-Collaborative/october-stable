        <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</p>
        <p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p>
        <p>
            A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in
            its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making
            blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and
            wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
        </p>
        <p>
            This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread
            concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side
            code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you donâ€™t have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you
            are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by
            running Node.js with flags.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-vast-number-of-libraries">A Vast Number of Libraries</h2>
        <p>
            npm with its simple structure helped the ecosystem of Node.js proliferate, and now the npm registry hosts over 1,000,000 open source packages you
            can freely use.
        </p>
        <h2 id="an-example-node.js-application">An Example Node.js Application</h2>
        <p>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:</p>
        <p>
            This code first includes the Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html"><code>http</code> module</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Node.js has a fantastic <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/">standard library</a>, including first-class support for networking.</p>
        <p>The <code>createServer()</code> method of <code>http</code> creates a new HTTP server and returns it.</p>
        <p>
            The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing
            us that the server is running.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a new request is received, the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request"><code>request</code> event</a> is called,
            providing two objects: a request (an
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage"><code>http.IncomingMessage</code></a> object) and a response (an
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse"><code>http.ServerResponse</code></a> object).
        </p>
        <p>Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.</p>
        <p>The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.</p>
        <p>The second is used to return data to the caller.</p>
        <p>In this case with:</p>
        <pre><code>res.statusCode = 200;</code></pre>
        <p>we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.</p>
        <p>We set the Content-Type header:</p>
        <pre><code>res.setHeader(&#39;Content-Type&#39;, &#39;text/plain&#39;);</code></pre>
        <p>and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to <code>end()</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>res.end(&#39;Hello World\n&#39;);</code></pre>
        <h2 id="node.js-frameworks-and-tools">Node.js Frameworks and Tools</h2>
        <p>
            Node.js is a low-level platform. In order to make things easy and exciting for developers, thousands of libraries were built upon Node.js by the
            community.
